# PrivMX Endpoint C# Extra

This library extends the [base library](https://github.com/simplito/privmx-endpoint-csharp) used by PrivMX to handle
end-to-end (e2e) encryption. PrivMX is a privacy-focused platform designed to offer secure
collaboration solutions by integrating robust encryption across various data types and communication
methods. This project enables seamless integration of PrivMX’s encryption functionalities in
C# applications, preserving the security and performance of the original C++ library while making its
capabilities accessible on the .NET platform.

## About PrivMX

[PrivMX](https://privmx.dev) allows developers to build end-to-end encrypted apps used for
communication. The Platform works according to privacy-by-design mindset, so all of our solutions
are based on Zero-Knowledge architecture. This project extends PrivMX’s commitment to security by
making its encryption features accessible to developers using C#.

### Key Features

- End-to-End Encryption: Ensures that data is encrypted at the source and can only be decrypted by
  the intended recipient.
- Native C++ Library Integration: Leverages the performance and security of C++ while making it
  accessible in C# applications.
- Cross-Platform Compatibility: Designed to support PrivMX on multiple operating systems and
  environments.
- Simple API: Easy-to-use interface for C# developers without compromising security.

## Library

PrivMX Endpoint C# Extra provides additional functionality for [PrivMX Endpoint C#](https://github.com/simplito/privmx-endpoint-csharp).
